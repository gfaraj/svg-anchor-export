# svg-anchor-export
Converts an SVG file that contains anchors into an FBX file.

This project was made for a very specific use case. It converts an SVG's paths to an (ascii) FBX with points along those paths. The purpose of this is to import the FBX into Unity and use the points on the paths for a spline animation. Each path includes a small cube to be used to extract color information for that path.
